Rope-and-Ball Simulation

Project Overview

This project simulates the interaction between balls connected to ropes, constrained within a bounded area. The simulation visualizes dynamic behaviors such as collisions, forces exerted by ropes, and the response of balls to these forces and boundaries.

Features

Dynamic Ball Movement: Balls respond to forces from ropes and collisions with walls and other balls.

Elastic Rope Forces: Ropes exert force when stretched beyond their natural length, following Hooke's law.

Wall and Ball Collisions: Balls collide with walls and each other, conserving momentum during collisions.

Real-Time Visualization: The simulation is animated using Matplotlib for an interactive view of the system.
